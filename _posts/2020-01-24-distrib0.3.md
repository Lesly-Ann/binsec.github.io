Following the release of BINSEC 0.3, packaged version of the
tool are now available for Docker and [OPAM][opam].

The Docker container can be pulled by:

```shell
docker pull binsec/binsec-0.3:v1
```


Our OPAM package has just been merged in [see [here][opamok]] and should
therefore be available shortly from this source as well.
