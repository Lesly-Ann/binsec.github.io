    <p> The UAFUZZ directed fuzzing module of BINSEC has discovered <b>30 new bugs in 6 widely used programs</b> (GPAC, GNU Patch, Perl 5, MuPDF, Boolector, fontforge), made of 1.9M lines of code. In September 2020, <b>17 of these bugs had been fixed</b> by the vendors and <b>7 have resulted in new CVEs</b>. </p>

    <p> Our BINSEC/REL relational symbolic execution module has analysed 338 cryptographic primitives (from e.g. HACL*, OpenSSL, BearSSL and NaCL), notably <b>proving that 296 of the binaries were resilient to cache-based timing attacks</b>, while <b>finding 3 new binary-level vulnerabilities</b> (from secure source codes), introduced by the compiler.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Translation to C of all the x86/ARM assembly embedded in the Linux codebase</h4>

    <p>In less than 1/2 hour, the TInA assembly lifter module of BINSEC has <b>securely translated 2000+ x86 or ARM assembly chunks to C</b>, all extracted from a typical Debian Linux distribution (including FFMPEG, ALSA and GMP), <b>enhancing</b> so <b>automatic analyses for Linux code</b> at the C level. </p>

    <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Complete deobfuscation of the government-grade X-Tunnel malware</h4>

    <p> The backward-bounded dynamic symbolic execution module of BINSEC has automatically detected obfuscating "opaque predicates" in two samples of the X-Tunnel malware, leading to a significant (and automatic) simplification of their code – <b>removing all spurious and dead instructions seeded to obscure the binaries</b>.</p>
